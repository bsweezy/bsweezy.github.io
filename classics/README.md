What are my favorite classical music tracks? Here are some. As I put this together, I realized a bunch of these are already super, super well-known. I've categorized these so if you're already familiar with the hits, you can jump straight to the deeper cuts. That said, oftentimes people know the key movement or melody from the huge hits--but if it's on this list, I really recommend the whole work itself. There's so much more going on in these than their most famous passages.

## vocal and orchestra
* bernstein chichester psalms (20th century, hebrew, my dad sang this at the dedication of the National Cathedral)
* dvorak stabat mater (no one knows this and it kind of pitters out after 1st movement and if you don't like its chromatic melody then skip it because it's that over and over again--something about this just really really connected with me though, got me interested in settings of the "stabat mater")
* gabriel faure cantique de jean racine (short, beautiful, find a recording with a harmonium not an organ)
* Penderecki Polish Requiem (very atonal)
* mozart requiem (even if he only wrote 2/3 of it)
* brahms requiem
* beethoven 9th (just the last movement is a "hit" but man the whole thing is great)
* one of the mahler symphonies (maybe two!) but I never have put my finger on it
