**Favorite Classical music.** What are my favorite classical music tracks? Here are some. As I put this together, I realized a bunch of these are already super, super well-known. I've categorized these so if you're already familiar with the hits, you can jump straight to the deeper cuts. That said, oftentimes people know the key movement or melody from the huge hits--but if it's on this list, I really recommend the whole work itself. There's so much more going on in these than their most famous passages. Spotify Playlist recordings are Berliner Philharmoniker where possible/appropriate. Compared to an overall primer of baroque/classical/romantic/modern music, these choices lean *very hard* on the Romantic period, and is symphony-heavy. Not meant to be representative of all music!

## vocal and orchestra

* dvorak stabat mater (no one knows this and it kind of pitters out after 1st movement and if you don't like its chromatic melody then skip it because it's that over and over again--something about this just really really connected with me though, got me interested in settings of the "stabat mater")
