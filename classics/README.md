**Favorite Classical music.** What are my favorite classical music tracks? Here are some. As I put this together, I realized a bunch of these are already super, super well-known. I've categorized these so if you're already familiar with the hits, you can jump straight to the deeper cuts. That said, oftentimes people know the key movement or melody from the huge hits--but if it's on this list, I really recommend the whole work itself. There's so much more going on in these than their most famous passages. Spotify Playlist recordings are Berliner Philharmoniker where possible/appropriate. Compared to an overall primer of baroque/classical/romantic/modern music, these choices lean *very hard* on the Romantic period, and is symphony-heavy. Not meant to be representative of all music!

## more obscure orchestral
[Spotify Playlist of 2 - Deeper in the Crates](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/699zahUlVCfVF6plgDjSbX?si=BI_vQNmhSjy5Lz6qFtqKyA)
* Mizesko "Sketches from Pinehurst" (2005, not on Spotify)
* tchaikovsky's 6th (40m) :heart:
* rachmaninoff piano concerto #1-4 (90m)
* erik satie gymonopedies & gnossiennes (20m)
* borodin in the steppes of central asia (11m)

  * *(for johninirish: "premiered in 1789 as one of a set of three symphonies that Haydn had been commissioned by the French Count d'Ogny to compose")
* Smetana MÃ¡ vlast (esp The Moldau) 1874-9 (1hr)
  * *"Each poem depicts some aspect of the countryside, history, or legends of Bohemia."
  * *The Moldau is an ode to the river running through Prague. listen to the similar "sound of a river" in this orchestral setting to the beginning of Das Rheingold--which makes the similiarity to Hatikhva (1877) all the more odd.

## great studying
[Spotify Playlist link for 3 - Studying](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1QMpNrxws9ut4yghbLTfF2?si=KaJqe8GBS66r36-LnrnwhQ)

## vocal and orchestra
* bernstein chichester psalms (20th century, hebrew)
* dvorak stabat mater (no one knows this and it kind of pitters out after 1st movement and if you don't like its chromatic melody then skip it because it's that over and over again--something about this just really really connected with me though, got me interested in settings of the "stabat mater")
* gabriel faure cantique de jean racine :heart: (short, beautiful, find a recording with a harmonium not an organ)
* Penderecki Polish Requiem (very atonal)
* mozart requiem (even if he only wrote 2/3 of it)
* brahms requiem
* beethoven 9th :heart:
  * * obviously the last movement qualifies as a "hit" but man the whole thing is great
* one of the mahler symphonies (maybe two!) but I never have put my finger on it
