<DD>Desktop software is produced or upgraded on an
18-month cycle. One software upgrade can usually be skipped without suffering
productivity or support issues. But by the end of the third year, the software must be
upgraded to keep up with vendor support, and compatibility within and among agencies
and other partners. It is frequently impossible to continue using an older version, because
incompatibility with other systems eventually forces an upgrade. Once one workgroup
upgrades, everyone in the agency needs to upgrade to maintain compatibility, or else
document compatibility and information- sharing issues become prominent, and support
costs increase with the complexity of multiple versions. The software then drives the
hardware needs by requiring more memory, storage capacity, and faster processing
speeds. Likewise, when a central service agency, such as the Office of Financial
Management, upgrades or requires a specific version of a program for use with central
systems, all agencies using that system must upgrade as well.

<DD>Thought you all would enjoy this. In 1944 the OSS ( predecessor agency to the CIA) developed the &quot;Simple Sabotage Field Manual&quot; - a pamphlet for German nationals who worked in the Nazi bureaucracy but were Allied Forces sympathizers. There were simple but effective ways to much up the Nazi machinery (both literal and figurative). 

Skip past the sections on sabotaging buildings, water sources, manufacturing centers, railways, and telegraphs. The really good reading starts on page 28: General Interference with Organizations and Production.

I think a lot of it will resonate with you. 

Without further adieu, I give you, the Simple Sabotage Field Manual.

<DD>The matrix was popularized in Stephen Covey’s famous book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and is named after President Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower was well-known for being tremendously productive, which Covey credits to his “first things first” attitude on how to spend your time. And to Eisenhower, the “first things” were always the important ones. He believed you should spend nearly all of your time in Quadrants 1 and 2, and he accomplished this with a simple D-word for each quadrant:

And that’s fantastic for Dwight fucking Eisenhower. But you know what Dwight clearly didn’t have in his bald head? An all-powerful Instant Gratification Monkey. If he had, he’d know that a procrastinator’s matrix looks like this:

<DD>Gallup had always wanted to be a newspaper editor, but after graduating from the University of Iowa, in 1923, he entered a Ph.D. program in applied psychology. In 1928, in a dissertation called “An Objective Method for Determining Reader Interest in the Content of a Newspaper,” Gallup argued that “at one time the press was depended upon as the chief agency for instructing and informing the mass of people” but that newspapers no longer filled that role and instead ought to meet “a greater need for entertainment.” He therefore devised a method: he’d watch readers go through a newspaper column by column and mark up the parts they liked, so that he could advise an editor which parts of the paper to keep printing and which parts to scrap.

Burdick’s dystopianism is vintage Cold War: the Strangelovian fear of the machine. (Burdick also co-wrote “Fail Safe,” in which a computer error triggers a nuclear war.) But after 1960 the D.N.C. essentially abandoned computer simulation. One reason may have been that L.B.J. wasn’t as interested in the work of M.I.T. scientists as Kennedy had been. For decades, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to use computer-based polling. In 1977, the R.N.C. acquired a mainframe computer, while the D.N.C. got its own mainframe in the eighties. The political scientist Kenneth Janda speculates that the technological advantage of the Republican Party during these years stemmed from its ties to big business. Democratic technological advances awaited the personal computer; the R.N.C. is to I.B.M. as the D.N.C. is to Apple. Then came the Internet, which, beginning with the so-called MoveOn effect, favored Democrats but, as Matthew Hindman argued in “The Myth of Digital Democracy,” has not favored democracy.

The study, based partly on 35 in-depth interviews with chief executives and other leaders of local companies, also identified other barriers to economic growth in the region, including inequalities and competition among jurisdictions and Washington’s reputation for political gridlock and inefficiency.

The survey was commissioned by the Roadmap group. It is seeking an ambitious, area-wide response to the historic slowdown in federal spending.

OMB’s initial draft of FITARA guidance survived the interagency review process remarkably intact. The version that is out for comments now is in many respects a model for how policy guidance should be developed. OMB Deputy Director for Management Beth Cobert, CIO Tony Scott, and E-Government chief Lisa Schlosser should be commended for producing a public policy document that will make a difference rather than just answering the mail.

<DD>If big data is to become a standard tool by which the government operates, aging legacy IT systems will have to modernize. This is no small feat, given that 70 percent of the federal government's $79 billion IT budget in 2011 was spent on maintaining existing systems. Many federal systems still run Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL), a programming language developed in 1959, ten years before NASA put a man on the moon.
But perhaps the biggest obstacle required before big data becomes a big staple in the government's IT arsenal is peoples' &quot;goals and attitudes,&quot; Silver said.
Old-hat policies need to change – Silver later told feds at the conference that &quot;bureaucracy is the enemy of imagination,&quot; to smiles and knowing glances around the room. Changing policies means changing people's beliefs about what big data is and what it might do.
Big data is not a cure-all, and it is inherently filled with noise and uncertainty, but it does have tremendous potential if people approach if the right way. &quot;The world is not lacking for techniques, it's more about the right goals and right attitudes,&quot; Silver said.
In November, NOAA's big-data based supercomputers took in data from polar-orbiting satellites, weather buoys and Gulfstream-IV and P-3 jets to churn out high-resolution computer models of Hurricane Sandy's path every six hours for several days before the storm landed. Residents in the storm's path had ample warning, and though more than 100 people died, without big data the net loss of life would have been far higher.
Even in its infancy, big data is changing the way agencies perform. The Department of Health and Human Services is changing the way it responds to disasters and the Department of Defense's global shared service center has implemented a big-dated based business activity monitoring software tool that has so far detected $4 billion in improper payments.
&quot;One thing data doesn't do is tell you what your goals ought to be,&quot; Silver said. &quot;You still have to think about what to accomplish. Data is not a substitute for judgments you have to make.&quot;

<DD>he trouble with data
However, much of that data is still locked-away in separate silos, created for a time when a dataset served a single human need. We tend to release our data in separate files or documents, the result being hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets on various websites, even if they are all brought together through the government’s data portal (www.data.gov.uk). Publishing in this disconnected, piecemeal way can create significant overheads. Spreadsheets are hard to find and difficult to use when the user only requires certain columns from a particular file. The result is a user community that spends significant time and effort copying, pasting and reformatting data before they can use it.

These problems are exacerbated when users combine DCLG data with other third-party sources. For instance, imagine you are a homelessness advisor wanting to link together separate spreadsheets from DCLG, Ministry of Justice and Local Authority data on, say, homelessness and housing in Cornwall. How has each data publisher defined Cornwall in its own spreadsheet? Have they used names or codes, and are these consistent across all sources? We invariably find a lack of commonality or standards here, which again translates into unnecessary time and effort to prepare data for re-use.

Bob Behn

The Office of Management and Budget says &quot;stat&quot; sessions -- Portofolio Stat, Tech Stat, etc. -- have saved the government millions of dollars. Agencies are developing their own approaches to the Stat model. Bob Behn is Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He publishes the Performance Leadership Report, and his latest book is The PerformanceStat Potential: A Leadership Strategy for Producing Results. On In Depthwith Francis Rose, Bob said one big problem with implementing Stat sessions is convincing people they won't be bashing sessions.

<DD>Almost every “person problem” is really a structure problem—a crack in the system where the rule-makers have failed to effectively communicate with the rule-followers.

Back when I ran Yola, a quotation attributed to George Patton often came into my head: “Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.” Personal ingenuity flourishes when there is a strong structural foundation in place—when people know exactly what is expected of them.

<DD>However, we appear to have stalled out a bit in our progress towards government as platform. It’s incredibly difficult to ingest the data for successful commercial products. The kaleidoscope of data formats in open data portals like data.gov might politely be called ‘obscure’, and perhaps more accurately, ‘perversely unusable’. Some of the data hasn’t been updated since first publication, and is quite positively too stale to use. If documentation exists, most of the time it’s incomprehensible.

<DD>Operations researchers have traditionally been concerned with well-structured problems which have one best solution or a range of acceptable solutions. Social scientists, on the other hand, deal with hard-to-structure problems in which it is very difficult to define what “best” means let alone find the best solution. Stated differently, operations research attempts to find the most efficient means of reaching a goal given a particular problem formulation. In contrast, social sciences tend to question the validity of the goal itself by treating the problem formulation not as a given but as open to challenge and revision.

This CAO insisted that findings matched business opinions and projected desired perceptions; anything inconsistent was discarded. Because the CAO didn't support lieutenants as they dealt with opinion-based clients, these clients felt free to push harder to make results fit their opinions and to make their performance look good.

<DD>Besides the secret list, the Phoenix VA hospital already provided a different, official wait list to DC that allowed VA higher-ups to verify that patients are being treated in a timely manner (within 14 to 30 days). But Phoenix's secret wait list supposedly avoided federal oversight with an elaborate scheme in which officials shredded evidence that some patients were taking months to be seen. What's worse, if someone died while waiting for an appointment due to the secret wait list, Phoenix officials would allegedly discard the name as if the fatal error never happened.

<DD>In the studio today is David Rubal, Public Sector Pre-Sales Consulting Manager with Tableau Software.
Tableau makes it easy for people to rapidly transform data into smart business analytics.

Their self-service analytics tool helps federal agencies perform fast, ad hoc analysis on data of any size and format without special coding or scripting.

This solves a key problem federal information professionals have - they are bombarded with massive data sets and are striving to get a handle on what that &quot;big data&quot; means.

During the interview, Rubal discusses big data in government and how Tableau Software helps Federal agencies see and understand data through native connectors to 40 spreadsheet, data warehouse, cube, database and big data sources.

Not just big data, but garden variety data as well.

Rubal explains how to use Tableau with traditional data sources to create interactive financial, operational and mission-critical visualizations, views and dashboards.

For more face-to-face information, Tableau is sponsoring their first Government Executive Forum in DC in November.

<DD>According to an explanation of customer satisfaction developed by the author, customer satisfaction is at risk every time a prospect or customer comes into contact with any aspect of a supplier company.  Each contact, or moment of truth, is an opportunity to strengthen or weaken customer satisfaction.  Level of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction with a supplier is the result of a customer’s cumulative total experience with these moments of truth.  Prospects and customers have six points of contact with a supplier: the supplier’s core products or services (e.g., cleaning and polishing chemicals, motor vehicle parts, contract security services, banking services); policies (e.g., credit and warranty policies); procedures (e.g., ordering and returned goods procedures); non-core business functions (e.g., billing); properties (e.g., vehicle fleet, Web site, voice mail system); and personnel (e.g., switchboard operator, service technician, customer service rep, sales staff).  

A company’s market research and management practices determine customers’ experiences at these six points of contact.  

To ensure customers consistently have experiences that give them reasons to keep coming back, a company’s managers require timely and complete information about customers’ standards for the company’s core products or services, procedures, policies, properties, personnel and non-core business functions

<DD>Mike Bostock: Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize an algorithm, we don’t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset. Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them.

But algorithms are also a reminder that visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data. Visualization leverages the human visual system to augment human intellect: we can use it to better understand these important abstract processes, and perhaps other things, too.

<DD>Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, &quot;lean&quot;, is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, &quot;value&quot; is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.
Essentially, lean is centered on preserving value with less work. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as &quot;lean&quot; only in the 1990s.[1][2] TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota, from a small company to the world's largest automaker,[3] has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.

<DD>Learning
The Learning project aims to investigate advanced techniques for assisting users in learning complicated applications. We are interested in a range of investigations from the scientific study of the human learning process to prototyping novel interaction techniques for improving the general learning mechanisms that can be applied to all applications.

One of our main observations is that the fundamental application provided learning mechanism, the &quot;help system&quot;, has not changed much in the last 10 years or so. However, our computing environment has undergone significant changes such as:

Widespread Internet usage
Google searching (and indexing of vast quantities of information)
Cheap video streaming (e.g., YouTube)
Larger and higher resolution displays
CPU/GPU speed improvements
Online communities
The Learning project will focus on a variety of research questions such as:

Can we improve the way people learn complicated applications?
Can we provide ways of capturing expert workflows and share them with colleagues by visualizing the workflows within an application?
Are there ways of intelligently recommending contextually-based learning material to users based on analyzing CIP data (time-stamped command histories) reported by thousands of users and comparing that to a user's own command history?
Can we visualize and detect patterns of command usage and command sequencing to help inform interface design?

decision aids that reduce bias and enable fuller use of information and 4) ethical 
considerations including effects on stakeholders. It is a no-fad, no-fluff approach 
to developing better managers and leading effective and adaptive organizations. 
EBMgt is a product of the distinct yet interdependent activities of practitioners, 
educators and scholars. This chapter discusses how each contribute to the 
advancement and use of EBMgt.

<DD>Despite its intuitive appeal, evidence-based management (EBMgt) faces unique 
challenges in “macro” areas such as Organization Theory and Strategy 
Management, which emphasize actions by organizations, and business and 
corporate leaders. The inherent focus on complex, multi-level and unique 
problems present serious challenges. EBMgt will nurture the establishment of a 
new model of research that is not only cumulative in its knowledge-building but 
also promotes engaged scholarship. Further, the uncertainty and conflict that 
characterize “macro” decision contexts heighten the need for EBMgt. We put 
forward four recommendations to advance EBMgt: (1) using more sophisticated 
meta-analyses; (2) providing syntheses that go beyond quantitative summaries; 
(3) engaging in a disciplined conversation about our implicit “levels of evidence” 
frameworks; and (4) developing decision supports.

<DD>Indeed, as more human behaviors are being measured, the line between the quantitative and the qualitative has blurred. I admire Brian Burke, who led the U.S. men’s hockey team on an Olympic run in 2010 and who has been an outspoken advocate for gay-rights causes in sports. But Burke said something on the hockey analytics panel at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference last month that I took issue with. He expressed concern that statistics couldn’t measure a hockey player’s perseverance. For instance, he asked, would one of his forwards retain control of the puck when Zdeno Chara, the Boston Bruins’ intimidating 6’9″ defenseman, was bearing down on him?

The thing is, this is something you could measure. You could watch video of all Bruins games and record how often different forwards kept control of the puck. Soon, the NHL may install motion-tracking cameras in its arenas, as other sports leagues have done, creating a record of each player’s x- and y-coordinates throughout the game and making this data collection process much easier.

I would ask a lot of questions of this data if I had it. For instance:

 Is it smart for a player to keep control of the puck when Chara (or a similarly gifted defensemen) has him in his sights? Might the player yield fewer turnovers if he passed the puck instead?
Would measuring a player’s perseverance give us meaningful information beyond what is reflected in “box score” statistics, such as goals, assists and plus-minus?
Do players who persevere under threat match those who are regarded as “tough” or as having lot of “heart” by coaches, scouts and commentators? If not, is the metric flawed, or are the coaches biased?
The quality of hockey statistics is fairly poor compared to those for baseball or basketball, so I can understand Burke’s skepticism. But often, general managers and CEOs and op-ed columnists use the lack of data as an excuse to avoid having to examine their premises.

<DD>Charles Jeffress served as assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health during the late 1990s. In this interview, Jeffress argues that federal workplace safety laws are weak, pointing out that &quot;to willfully violate the law and kill someone is a misdemeanor under the OSHA Act.&quot; He also explains how the theory behind the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act was to be preventive and assess penalties for existing hazards. However, he warns that in practice the OSHA law &quot;has inadequate teeth&quot; for the federal government to rein in a rogue company. This is an edited transcript of his interview with FRONTLINE, conducted on Sept. 30, 2002.

OPPORTUNITY FOR DATA ANALYTICS:
So if you go to OSHA's central file system in Washington and typed in Tyler Pipe, you wouldn't necessarily come up with connections to all the other plants that are related to it?

No. The OSHA investigator, when they're making a determination of what penalty to issue, researches the corporate history of the company, tries to research the corporate ties of the company. If there are two different sites under different names but owned by same management, it is possible to tie the two together, which might have the impact of increasing the penalty. But in this day and age of companies operating under lots of different names and difficult to track down, we don't always tie together two subsidiaries to the same holding company.

FAMILIAR TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

You say that, for most companies, it's good business to comply, to take care of their workers. What we've discovered, at least in one case, is that a company has all the right paperwork. They post all the signs, have the manuals, but really doesn't instruct its workers or have group meetings. Safety is considered a cost of doing business, and it's better business, apparently, to ignore it, in reality.

There are companies with good programs on paper, written by some consultant some place, but never applied in the workplace. Then it's easy to tell when you walk into a workplace; within 30 minutes, you can tell whether there's attention being paid to the details that are necessary to keep people safe or not. ...

But in terms of safety being a good policy or good program or safety pays -- if you account for the costs of an accident, not just the hurt to the individual, not just the payment to that family and the medical bills, but if you look at training the new workers to take its place; you look at the down time that occurs when a serious accident occurs; you look at the damage to the equipment; you look at all the time that the corporation and officers of the corporation spend reviewing the accident, trying to correct that problem -- for a good company that takes its job seriously and safety, the cost of an accident is probably 10 times the actual dollar outlay for the injured worker.

There are many, many hidden aspects of an accident that a company that's doing its job pays. So when we say safety pays, when we say an investment in safety pays off, you avoid not only the cost to the individual, but you avoid all those indirect costs.

Does the OSHA law adequately protect workers in the United States?

No. OSHA law cannot adequately protect workers in the United States [for] a couple of reasons. One, OSHA can't be everywhere. The protection of an individual worker starts at that plant level -- that worker looking out for himself or looking out for his or her fellow employees. That's the most important thing anybody can do to running safe on the job -- have a conscious program of looking after each other. OSHA can't be everywhere any time.

OSHA has to be able to give support to those employees who don't get support from their employers. When there are employers that are careless or overlook or don't give any priority to safety and health, OSHA has to be available to come in and help those employees get the employer's attention, if you will, and force action. But on a daily basis, there's no way OSHA's going to be in every workplace. ...

<DD>Research methods. We use a variety of methods (both quantitative and qualitative strategies, exploratory analyses, controlled experimentation, and statistical modeling) to answer research questions.
Collaboration. We mostly work by embedding ourselves in the teams that we support. We believe that we work best with customers when we participate in the design process from a very early stage to identify research questions that new products or programs are designed to answer. We also support the teams we work with by advising towards best practices on instrumentation, data modeling, data visualization and the definition of key performance metrics. To determine the best approach and prioritize research questions we typically consult with program and product owners on a quarterly basis, or on a per-project basis as needed.
Transparency. We strive to make the process and output of our work as transparent as possible, by publicly sharing the research reports (see the Research:Index), visualizations, code (see FIXME) and datasets (see our datahub.io group) that we produce. When we publish our work in academic outlets, we make sure that the results are openly accessible to the community.
Product development. We also work with the Analytics Development and the Wikimedia product and engineering teams to identify and prototype new analytics product ideas or ways to use data to improve user experience on Wikimedia sites.
Outreach. We work with community members and academic researchers to spearhead Wikimedia/Wikipedia research and to evangelize open research tools and data sources. We regularly hang out on IRC in the #wikimedia-researchconnect and #wikimedia-analyticsconnect channel, where you can reach us to ask us anything about our work. We are also familiar with the scholarly literature on Wikipedia and online collaboration in general and we strive to bridge the gap between the Foundation, our editor community and the research community by participating in various outreach initiatives.
Grantmaking. We support Wikimedia movement affiliates in making research-driven decisions about how to further our mission and strategic goals through grant funded projects, and how to demonstrate the impact of those projects.

<DD>Flowers was named to a special task force assigned to crunch the numbers that might unmask the villains of the subprime mortgage scandal in 2009. The unit was so successful that a year later Mayor Bloomberg asked it to expand its scope. Flowers became the city’s first “director of analytics.” His mission: to build a team of the best data scientists he could find and harness the city’s untapped troves of information to reap efficiencies covering everything and anything.

Prior to the big-data analysis, inspectors followed up the complaints they deemed most dire, but only in 13 percent of cases did they find conditions severe enough to warrant a vacate order. Now they were issuing vacate orders on more than 70 percent of the buildings they inspected. 

Yet the most important reason for the program’s success was that it dispensed with a reliance on causation in favor of correlation.

“I am not interested in causation except as it speaks to action,” explains Flowers. “Causation is for other people, and frankly it is very dicey when you start talking about causation. I don’t think there is any cause whatsoever between the day that someone files a foreclosure proceeding against a property and whether or not that place has a historic risk for a structural fire. I think it would be obtuse to think so. And nobody would actually come out and say that. They’d think, no, it’s the underlying factors. But I don’t want to even get into that. I need a specific data point that I have access to, and tell me its significance. If it’s significant, then we’ll act on it. If not, then we won’t. You know, we have real problems to solve.

<DD>One of the hallmarks of Obama’s 2012 campaign was its prodigious appetite for research. The trio at the top — Messina, senior strategist David Axelrod and White House senior adviser David Plouffe — were enthusiastic consumers of research. Though different in their approaches to politics — Axelrod operated intuitively, Plouffe’s watchwords were “Prove it” and Messina wanted to be able to measure everything — they all pushed the campaign for more research, testing, analysis and innovation.

We did a very detailed postmortem where we looked at all kinds of numbers, looking at the general stuff like the number of door knocks we made, phone calls we made, number of voters that we registered,” said Mitch Stewart, who would direct the campaign’s 2012 effort in battleground states. “But then we broke it down by field organizer, we broke it down then by volunteer. We looked at the best way or the best examples in states of what their volunteer organization looked like

<DD>The experience map highlighted above was part of an overall initiative for Rail Europe, Inc., a US distributor that offers North American travelers a single place to book rail tickets and passes throughout Europe, instead of going to numerous websites. They already had a good website and an award-winning contact center, but they wanted to get a better handle on their customers’ journeys across all touchpoints, which would allow them to more fully understand where they should focus their budget, design and technology resources. Derived from this overall “diagnostic” evaluation, of which the map was just one part, were a number of recommendations for focused initiatives. The experience map helped create a shared empathic understanding of the customers' interactions with the Rail Europe touchpoints over time and space.
 
I almost always apply five critical components that make an experience map useful. And when I say useful, I'm thinking of two key criteria: First, it can stand on its own, meaning it can be circulated across an organization and doesn't need to be explained, framed or qualified. Like others, we make our experience maps large, often greater than five feet long. They're meant to engender a shared reference of the experience, consensus of the good and the bad.
 
Second, it's clearly a means to something actionable—ideally something to design around—and not an end in and of itself. A good experience map feels like a catalyst, not a conclusion.

HelloWallet** who has been a strong supporter of Data Community DC since
the beginning.*
I’m happy to announce that O’Reilly Media will be publishing a new book I’m
writing called *Designing for Behavior Change*. The book gives step-by-step
guidance on how to design, build, and test products that help people change
their daily behavior and routines. The goal is to help people take actions
that they want to take, but have struggled with in the past: from
exercising more (FitBit, Fuelband), to spending less on utilities (Opower,
Nest), to taking control of their finances (HelloWallet).
It’s a practical how-to book, aimed at designers, product folks, data
scientists, entrepreneurs and others who are thinking about and building
these products. It includes:
Insight into how the mind makes decisions, and what that means for changing
behavior. Step-by-step instructions on how to select a behavioral change
strategy, and convert that strategy into a real product. Techniques and
software tools for evaluating the concrete impact of a product on user
behavior, and for discovering the factors that block users from changing
their behavior. Lots of practical, concrete examples.
For those of you who have been reading my blog for a while, it covers some
of the same topics (how to sustain engagement with a product, how to
overcome existing habits, etc), but in much greater depth, and with an
overall framework to make sense of the product development process.
The book draws from our experiences here at HelloWallet over the last four
years, and well as from the dozens of companies I’ve had the joy of talking
with through the Action Design DC
Meetup&lt;http://www.meetup.com/action-design-dc&gt;,
and mentoring companies at The
Fort&lt;http://www.fortifyventures.com/the-accelerator/&gt;and 1776

email newsletter here &lt;http://eepurl.com/tJfgz&gt;

I’ll send out draft chapters as they become ready, and blog posts on
related topics.
I look forward to your feedback! I’d also love to hear about interesting
case studies and examples of companies doing this work.

<DD>What we need in the next president, in other words, is not just creative policy-making and politicking, but a willingness to drive the bureaucracy to perform. He or she must have a passion for managing the government itself.

It’s a tough order to fill. Considering the growing complexity and size of both the federal government and the challenges it has been asked to address, many would characterize it as Sisyphean. But fortunately, over the last couple of decades, through trial and error, new systems of goal setting, data gathering, and accountability have been developed in the public sector that attempt to give elected officials some of the same tools corporate leaders use to demand bottom-line results from their organizations. These new accountability systems are hardly panaceas; in fact, they have disappointed more often than they have succeeded. But it just so happens that the politician who is most broadly recognized to have made them work the best is none other than Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley.

<DD>Example of Huffington Post as a concrete result of analytically thinking through an abstract opportunity environment.

So eager was AOL to boost its content-driven traffic that in late 2010 it devised a strategy, The AOL Way. Management set markers: Monthly story production rate was to rise from 33,000 to 55,000, video from 4 percent of the content to 70 percent. All staffers were to write between five and 10 stories a day. To help them make those numbers, AOL produced a 60-page handbook filled with graphs, content flow charts, and such exhortations as “Each article should be profitable and generate at least 7k PVs/story.” Editors were to “Identify High-Demand Topics”; guidelines were provided to “breaking, seasonal, and evergreen.” Editors were commanded to calculate a story’s “profitability consideration.” “Site leaders” were expected to have on hand no less than eight packages that could produce $1 million in revenue. One employee anonymously told Business Insider, which broke the story, “AOL is the most fucked-up, bullshit company on earth.”

The AOL Way was, with apologies to Maimondes, “a guide for the perplexed.” 

 In 2010, HuffPost decided to reward its most engaged readers with three “badges” that signify the extent of that engagement: “networkers,” who draw fans and followers; “superusers,” who share often on Facebook and Twitter and who also comment frequently; and “moderators” who, in recognition of their keen eye and absorption of the site’s ethos, are trusted with deleting comments they judge inappropriate.

<DD>2006. Distinction between automobile dashboard versus aircraft navigation system. Emphasizes predictive and &quot;where you are going&quot; aspects of successful dashboards.

They proceeded to show us a number of reports from the current &quot;dashboard,&quot; which essentially reported on project status for ongoing projects. While the graphs, widgets, and colored diagrams were impressive to look at, closer examination revealed that all of the data consisted of &quot;lagging indicators.&quot; Many of the critical items that we had explored in our planning were not included at all. Beyond the missing leading indicators, how would this dashboard report on the progress toward their goals? Where was the critical item of &quot;value&quot;? Where did key compliance issues (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley, CMM®, various quality initiatives) fit in, since these weren't really projects?

We also knew that certain key items (e.g., project charters, specifications) were going to be most indicative of success or failure. Yet these were at best binary measures -- they were complete or not. In fact, a project didn't hit the &quot;radar&quot; until the charter was completed, so this critical step might not even be reflected in their existing dashboard. In the simulation, we had painstakingly mapped a number of assumptions and external factors. A key one was how fast they could acquire, train, and deploy additional resources. Was the resource factor included in the dashboard? Not really -- it showed nothing beyond the amount of these resources that had been consumed at a given point.

We believe that most often questions about data accuracy, data completeness, or historical data are red herrings. When we start arguing about the precision of metrics, we frequently find we have the wrong measures or the wrong presentation, or we are dealing with resistance that has nothing to do with the accuracy of the numbers. Measurement is supposed to make you uncomfortable. Questioning the accuracy of the numbers is how some people vent that discomfort.
Remember the IT department client we mentioned above? When we began replacing their plethora of spreadsheets with a version of the planning module we outlined earlier, we cautioned the consultant who was working on the model to remain calm when (not if) the accuracy of the data was attacked. Very early into a meeting on the new model, one of the participants began vigorously comparing our data to her spreadsheet and pointing out a series of minor discrepancies. The behavior was disruptive, but because we were prepared for this resistance, we stayed calm and didn't get into a defensive position or an argument. We quietly pointed out that the discrepancies were there because we were all working from a number of unrelated spreadsheets.
Prepare for arguments about data. Agree on the margin of error and what you will do about inaccuracies. Do this before you show your data or the results. Even then, beware the smokescreen and anticipate resistance. Metrics hold up a mirror, and the picture we see isn't always flattering. It can get emotional. Remember, if your metrics aren't making someone uncomfortable, they probably aren't the right metrics.

On the other hand, beware the homegrown Excel wizard. We've seen some systems built with a proliferation of spreadsheets, and while they appeared to be &quot;money savers&quot; at first, they ultimately cost more than the value they delivered. Often they were delivered quickly, but many were built on a house of cards -- undocumented macros that delivered results no one could justify. Even if you found the error, the safest presumption was that you'd never be able to fix it without rewriting the whole spreadsheet. That may sound extreme, but it's far more common than you might think.
