One software upgrade can usually be skipped without suffering\r\nproductivity or support issues. But by the end of the third year, the software must be\r\nupgraded to keep up with vendor support, and compatibility within and among agencies\r\nand other partners. It is frequently impossible to continue using an older version, because\r\nincompatibility with other systems eventually forces an upgrade. Once one workgroup\r\nupgrades, everyone in the agency needs to upgrade to maintain compatibility, or else\r\ndocument compatibility and information- sharing issues become prominent, and support\r\ncosts increase with the complexity of multiple versions. The software then drives the\r\nhardware needs by requiring more memory, storage capacity, and faster processing\r\nspeeds. Likewise, when a central service agency, such as the Office of Financial\r\nManagement, upgrades or requires a specific version of a program for use with central\r\nsystems, all agencies using that system must upgrade as well.

In 1928, in a dissertation called \u201cAn Objective Method for Determining Reader Interest in the Content of a Newspaper,\u201d Gallup argued that \u201cat one time the press was depended upon as the chief agency for instructing and informing the mass of people\u201d but that newspapers no longer filled that role and instead ought to meet \u201ca greater need for entertainment.\u201d He therefore devised a method: he\u2019d watch readers go through a newspaper column by column and mark up the parts they liked, so that he could advise an editor which parts of the paper to keep printing and which parts to scrap.\n\nBurdick\u2019s dystopianism is vintage Cold War: the Strangelovian fear of the machine. (Burdick also co-wrote \u201cFail Safe,\u201d in which a computer error triggers a nuclear war.) But after 1960 the D.N.C. essentially abandoned computer simulation. One reason may have been that L.B.J. wasn\u2019t as interested in the work of M.I.T. scientists as Kennedy had been. For decades, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to use computer-based polling. In 1977, the R.N.C. acquired a mainframe computer, while the D.N.C. got its own mainframe in the eighties. The political scientist Kenneth Janda speculates that the technological advantage of the Republican Party during these years stemmed from its ties to big business. Democratic technological advances awaited the personal computer; the R.N.C. is to I.B.M. as the D.N.C. is to Apple. Then came the Internet, which, beginning with the so-called MoveOn effect, favored Democrats but, as Matthew Hindman argued in \u201cThe Myth of Digital Democracy,\u201d has not favored democracy.","meta":"b3f54d81d42b8de3d88ac7cdca712323","hash":"131cf136e5cfc477a1294e92b5744328","time":"2015-11-18T05:48:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"analytics"},

This is no small feat, given that 70 percent of the federal government's $79 billion IT budget in 2011 was spent on maintaining existing systems. Many federal systems still run Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL), a programming language developed in 1959, ten years before NASA put a man on the moon.\nBut perhaps the biggest obstacle required before big data becomes a big staple in the government's IT arsenal is peoples' \"goals and attitudes,\" Silver said.\nOld-hat policies need to change \u2013 Silver later told feds at the conference that \"bureaucracy is the enemy of imagination,\" to smiles and knowing glances around the room. Changing policies means changing people's beliefs about what big data is and what it might do.\nBig data is not a cure-all, and it is inherently filled with noise and uncertainty, but it does have tremendous potential if people approach if the right way. \"The world is not lacking for techniques, it's more about the right goals and right attitudes,\" Silver said.\nIn November, NOAA's big-data based supercomputers took in data from polar-orbiting satellites, weather buoys and Gulfstream-IV and P-3 jets to churn out high-resolution computer models of Hurricane Sandy's path every six hours for several days before the storm landed. Residents in the storm's path had ample warning, and though more than 100 people died, without big data the net loss of life would have been far higher.\nEven in its infancy, big data is changing the way agencies perform. The Department of Health and Human Services is changing the way it responds to disasters and the Department of Defense's global shared service center has implemented a big-dated based business activity monitoring software tool that has so far detected $4 billion in improper payments.\n\"One thing data doesn't do is tell you what your goals ought to be,\" Silver said. \"You still have to think about what to accomplish. Data is not a substitute for judgments you have to make.\"","meta":"8bcb389dd28dc6757193be2fc1bb3d62","hash":"0548e73474bd64a4116d557d4e074ad4","time":"2015-05-12T15:19:42Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"public-management analytics bigdata-example"},

We tend to release our data in separate files or documents, the result being hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets on various websites, even if they are all brought together through the government\u2019s data portal (www.data.gov.uk). Publishing in this disconnected, piecemeal way can create significant overheads. Spreadsheets are hard to find and difficult to use when the user only requires certain columns from a particular file. The result is a user community that spends significant time and effort copying, pasting and reformatting data before they can use it.\r\n\r\nThese problems are exacerbated when users combine DCLG data with other third-party sources. For instance, imagine you are a homelessness advisor wanting to link together separate spreadsheets from DCLG, Ministry of Justice and Local Authority data on, say, homelessness and housing in Cornwall. How has each data publisher defined Cornwall in its own spreadsheet? Have they used names or codes, and are these consistent across all sources? We invariably find a lack of commonality or standards here, which again translates into unnecessary time and effort to prepare data for re-use.","meta":"e84b44a477ec6c9e16f3d82cc8edcef2","hash":"ed8ebcf062676cca941b01dccd18c60c","time":"2015-01-03T19:12:41Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"cdo data citm-list"},

Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as \"lean\" only in the 1990s.[1][2] TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota, from a small company to the world's largest automaker,[3] has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.","meta":"3fd5b18ef7bd84ca96799464822060a1","hash":"7dd275cc3413842fe1c75ee3eca17c14","time":"2014-06-20T18:20:25Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"lean public-management"},

{"href":"http:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/what-the-fox-knows\/","description":"FiveThirtyEight | What the Fox Knows","extended":"Indeed, as more human behaviors are being measured, the line between the quantitative and the qualitative has blurred. I admire Brian Burke, who led the U.S. men\u2019s hockey team on an Olympic run in 2010 and who has been an outspoken advocate for gay-rights causes in sports. But Burke said something on the hockey analytics panel at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference last month that I took issue with. He expressed concern that statistics couldn\u2019t measure a hockey player\u2019s perseverance. For instance, he asked, would one of his forwards retain control of the puck when Zdeno Chara, the Boston Bruins\u2019 intimidating 6\u20199\u2033 defenseman, was bearing down on him?\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this is something you could measure. You could watch video of all Bruins games and record how often different forwards kept control of the puck. Soon, the NHL may install motion-tracking cameras in its arenas, as other sports leagues have done, creating a record of each player\u2019s x- and y-coordinates throughout the game and making this data collection process much easier.\r\n\r\nI would ask a lot of questions of this data if I had it. For instance:\r\n\r\n Is it smart for a player to keep control of the puck when Chara (or a similarly gifted defensemen) has him in his sights? Might the player yield fewer turnovers if he passed the puck instead?\r\nWould measuring a player\u2019s perseverance give us meaningful information beyond what is reflected in \u201cbox score\u201d statistics, such as goals, assists and plus-minus?\r\nDo players who persevere under threat match those who are regarded as \u201ctough\u201d or as having lot of \u201cheart\u201d by coaches, scouts and commentators?

{"href":"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/shows\/workplace\/osha\/jeffress.html","description":"Osha - Charles Jeffress | A Dangerous Business | FRONTLINE | PBS","extended":"Charles Jeffress served as assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health during the late 1990s. In this interview, Jeffress argues that federal workplace safety laws are weak, pointing out that \"to willfully violate the law and kill someone is a misdemeanor under the OSHA Act.\" He also explains how the theory behind the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act was to be preventive and assess penalties for existing hazards. However, he warns that in practice the OSHA law \"has inadequate teeth\" for the federal government to rein in a rogue company. This is an edited transcript of his interview with FRONTLINE, conducted on Sept. 30, 2002.\n\nOPPORTUNITY FOR DATA ANALYTICS:\nSo if you go to OSHA's central file system in Washington and typed in Tyler Pipe, you wouldn't necessarily come up with connections to all the other plants that are related to it?\n\nNo. The OSHA investigator, when they're making a determination of what penalty to issue, researches the corporate history of the company, tries to research the corporate ties of the company. If there are two different sites under different names but owned by same management, it is possible to tie the two together, which might have the impact of increasing the penalty. But in this day and age of companies operating under lots of different names and difficult to track down, we don't always tie together two subsidiaries to the same holding company.\n\nFAMILIAR TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n\nYou say that, for most companies, it's good business to comply, to take care of their workers. What we've discovered, at least in one case, is that a company has all the right paperwork. They post all the signs, have the manuals, but really doesn't instruct its workers or have group meetings. Safety is considered a cost of doing business, and it's better business, apparently, to ignore it, in reality.\n\nThere are companies with good programs on paper, written by some consultant some place, but never applied in the workplace. Then it's easy to tell when you walk into a workplace; within 30 minutes, you can tell whether there's attention being paid to the details that are necessary to keep people safe or not. ...\n\nBut in terms of safety being a good policy or good program or safety pays -- if you account for the costs of an accident, not just the hurt to the individual, not just the payment to that family and the medical bills, but if you look at training the new workers to take its place; you look at the down time that occurs when a serious accident occurs; you look at the damage to the equipment; you look at all the time that the corporation and officers of the corporation spend reviewing the accident, trying to correct that problem -- for a good company that takes its job seriously and safety, the cost of an accident is probably 10 times the actual dollar outlay for the injured worker.\n\nThere are many, many hidden aspects of an accident that a company that's doing its job pays. So when we say safety pays, when we say an investment in safety pays off, you avoid not only the cost to the individual, but you avoid all those indirect costs.\n\nDoes the OSHA law adequately protect workers in the United States?\n\nNo. OSHA law cannot adequately protect workers in the United States [for] a couple of reasons. One, OSHA can't be everywhere. The protection of an individual worker starts at that plant level -- that worker looking out for himself or looking out for his or her fellow employees. That's the most important thing anybody can do to running safe on the job -- have a conscious program of looking after each other. OSHA can't be everywhere any time.\n\nOSHA has to be able to give support to those employees who don't get support from their employers. When there are employers that are careless or overlook or don't give any priority to safety and health, OSHA has to be available to come in and help those employees get the employer's attention, if you will, and force action. But on a daily basis, there's no way OSHA's going to be in every workplace. ...","meta":"08e29c29752beebb52bade2deb9d877f","hash":"aead29253de15af022e2de310c47e638","time":"2014-01-21T20:35:38Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"nc public-management"},

We mostly work by embedding ourselves in the teams that we support. We believe that we work best with customers when we participate in the design process from a very early stage to identify research questions that new products or programs are designed to answer. We also support the teams we work with by advising towards best practices on instrumentation, data modeling, data visualization and the definition of key performance metrics. To determine the best approach and prioritize research questions we typically consult with program and product owners on a quarterly basis, or on a per-project basis as needed.\r\nTransparency. We strive to make the process and output of our work as transparent as possible, by publicly sharing the research reports (see the Research:Index), visualizations, code (see FIXME) and datasets (see our datahub.io group) that we produce. When we publish our work in academic outlets, we make sure that the results are openly accessible to the community.\r\nProduct development. We also work with the Analytics Development and the Wikimedia product and engineering teams to identify and prototype new analytics product ideas or ways to use data to improve user experience on Wikimedia sites.\r\nOutreach. We work with community members and academic researchers to spearhead Wikimedia\/Wikipedia research and to evangelize open research tools and data sources.

The unit was so successful that a year later Mayor Bloomberg asked it to expand its scope. Flowers became the city\u2019s first \u201cdirector of analytics.\u201d His mission: to build a team of the best data scientists he could find and harness the city\u2019s untapped troves of information to reap efficiencies covering everything and anything.\n\nPrior to the big-data analysis, inspectors followed up the complaints they deemed most dire, but only in 13 percent of cases did they find conditions severe enough to warrant a vacate order. Now they were issuing vacate orders on more than 70 percent of the buildings they inspected. \n\nYet the most important reason for the program\u2019s success was that it dispensed with a reliance on causation in favor of correlation.\n\n\u201cI am not interested in causation except as it speaks to action,\u201d explains Flowers. \u201cCausation is for other people, and frankly it is very dicey when you start talking about causation. I don\u2019t think there is any cause whatsoever between the day that someone files a foreclosure proceeding against a property and whether or not that place has a historic risk for a structural fire. I think it would be obtuse to think so. And nobody would actually come out and say that. They\u2019d think, no, it\u2019s the underlying factors. But I don\u2019t want to even get into that. I need a specific data point that I have access to, and tell me its significance. If it\u2019s significant, then we\u2019ll act on it. If not, then we won\u2019t. You know, we have real problems to solve. I can\u2019t dick around, frankly, thinking about other things like causation right now.\u201d","meta":"33df77ca93f6904dc9f212e1bd41434b","hash":"a62c1693085c360f8b2bf15f7ddb35d7","time":"2013-12-28T18:48:22Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"nyc analytics bigdata-example"},

They already had a good website and an award-winning contact center, but they wanted to get a better handle on their customers\u2019 journeys across all touchpoints, which would allow them to more fully understand where they should focus their budget, design and technology resources. Derived from this overall \u201cdiagnostic\u201d evaluation, of which the map was just one part, were a number of recommendations for focused initiatives. The experience map helped create a shared empathic understanding of the customers' interactions with the Rail Europe touchpoints over time and space.\n \nI almost always apply five critical components that make an experience map useful. And when I say useful, I'm thinking of two key criteria: First, it can stand on its own, meaning it can be circulated across an organization and doesn't need to be explained, framed or qualified. Like others, we make our experience maps large, often greater than five feet long. They're meant to engender a shared reference of the experience, consensus of the good and the bad.\n \nSecond, it's clearly a means to something actionable\u2014ideally something to design around\u2014and not an end in and of itself. A good experience map feels like a catalyst, not a conclusion.","meta":"3e97f5e048461e94b702b60578d73951","hash":"aa923e3528ea49c0baeb0550c76a0ebc","time":"2013-06-17T19:05:44Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"management citm-list"},

The book gives step-by-step\nguidance on how to design, build, and test products that help people change\ntheir daily behavior and routines. The goal is to help people take actions\nthat they want to take, but have struggled with in the past: from\nexercising more (FitBit, Fuelband), to spending less on utilities (Opower,\nNest), to taking control of their finances (HelloWallet).\nIt\u2019s a practical how-to book, aimed at designers, product folks, data\nscientists, entrepreneurs and others who are thinking about and building\nthese products. It includes:\nInsight into how the mind makes decisions, and what that means for changing\nbehavior. Step-by-step instructions on how to select a behavioral change\nstrategy, and convert that strategy into a real product. Techniques and\nsoftware tools for evaluating the concrete impact of a product on user\nbehavior, and for discovering the factors that block users from changing\ntheir behavior. Lots of practical, concrete examples.\nFor those of you who have been reading my blog for a while, it covers some\nof the same topics (how to sustain engagement with a product, how to\novercome existing habits, etc), but in much greater depth, and with an\noverall framework to make sense of the product development process.\nThe book draws from our experiences here at HelloWallet over the last four\nyears, and well as from the dozens of companies I\u2019ve had the joy of talking\nwith through the Action Design DC\nMeetup<http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/action-design-dc>,\nand mentoring companies at The\nFort<http:\/\/www.fortifyventures.com\/the-accelerator\/>and 1776\nDC <http:\/\/1776dc.com>.\n*If **you\u2019d** like a free copy of the draft **eBook*, just sign up for my\nemail newsletter here <http:\/\/eepurl.com\/tJfgz>\n(http:\/\/<http:\/\/eepurl.com\/tJfgz>\neepurl.com <http:\/\/eepurl.com\/tJfgz>\/\n<http:\/\/eepurl.com\/tJfgz>tJfgz<http:\/\/eepurl.com\/tJfgz>).\nI\u2019ll send out draft chapters as they become ready, and blog posts on\nrelated topics.\nI look forward to your feedback!

He or she must have a passion for managing the government itself.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tough order to fill. Considering the growing complexity and size of both the federal government and the challenges it has been asked to address, many would characterize it as Sisyphean. But fortunately, over the last couple of decades, through trial and error, new systems of goal setting, data gathering, and accountability have been developed in the public sector that attempt to give elected officials some of the same tools corporate leaders use to demand bottom-line results from their organizations. These new accountability systems are hardly panaceas; in fact, they have disappointed more often than they have succeeded. But it just so happens that the politician who is most broadly recognized to have made them work the best is none other than Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley.","meta":"3dbf45c73406973ebad4586893a09487","hash":"d4cb2e4da7a3b6c05ee8b835e637b232","time":"2013-05-07T01:31:54Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"public-management"},

Management set markers: Monthly story production rate was to rise from 33,000 to 55,000, video from 4 percent of the content to 70 percent. All staffers were to write between five and 10 stories a day. To help them make those numbers, AOL produced a 60-page handbook filled with graphs, content flow charts, and such exhortations as \u201cEach article should be profitable and generate at least 7k PVs\/story.\u201d Editors were to \u201cIdentify High-Demand Topics\u201d; guidelines were provided to \u201cbreaking, seasonal, and evergreen.\u201d Editors were commanded to calculate a story\u2019s \u201cprofitability consideration.\u201d \u201cSite leaders\u201d were expected to have on hand no less than eight packages that could produce $1 million in revenue.

Distinction between automobile dashboard versus aircraft navigation system. Emphasizes predictive and \"where you are going\" aspects of successful dashboards.\n\nThey proceeded to show us a number of reports from the current \"dashboard,\" which essentially reported on project status for ongoing projects. While the graphs, widgets, and colored diagrams were impressive to look at, closer examination revealed that all of the data consisted of \"lagging indicators.\" Many of the critical items that we had explored in our planning were not included at all. Beyond the missing leading indicators, how would this dashboard report on the progress toward their goals? Where was the critical item of \"value\"? Where did key compliance issues (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley, CMM\u00ae, various quality initiatives) fit in, since these weren't really projects?\n\nWe also knew that certain key items (e.g., project charters, specifications) were going to be most indicative of success or failure. Yet these were at best binary measures -- they were complete or not. In fact, a project didn't hit the \"radar\" until the charter was completed, so this critical step might not even be reflected in their existing dashboard. In the simulation, we had painstakingly mapped a number of assumptions and external factors. A key one was how fast they could acquire, train, and deploy additional resources. Was the resource factor included in the dashboard? Not really -- it showed nothing beyond the amount of these resources that had been consumed at a given point.\n\nWe believe that most often questions about data accuracy, data completeness, or historical data are red herrings. When we start arguing about the precision of metrics, we frequently find we have the wrong measures or the wrong presentation, or we are dealing with resistance that has nothing to do with the accuracy of the numbers. Measurement is supposed to make you uncomfortable. Questioning the accuracy of the numbers is how some people vent that discomfort.\nRemember the IT department client we mentioned above? When we began replacing their plethora of spreadsheets with a version of the planning module we outlined earlier, we cautioned the consultant who was working on the model to remain calm when (not if) the accuracy of the data was attacked. Very early into a meeting on the new model, one of the participants began vigorously comparing our data to her spreadsheet and pointing out a series of minor discrepancies. The behavior was disruptive, but because we were prepared for this resistance, we stayed calm and didn't get into a defensive position or an argument. We quietly pointed out that the discrepancies were there because we were all working from a number of unrelated spreadsheets.\nPrepare for arguments about data. Agree on the margin of error and what you will do about inaccuracies. Do this before you show your data or the results. Even then, beware the smokescreen and anticipate resistance. Metrics hold up a mirror, and the picture we see isn't always flattering. It can get emotional. Remember, if your metrics aren't making someone uncomfortable, they probably aren't the right metrics.\n\nOn the other hand, beware the homegrown Excel wizard. We've seen some systems built with a proliferation of spreadsheets, and while they appeared to be \"money savers\" at first, they ultimately cost more than the value they delivered. Often they were delivered quickly, but many were built on a house of cards -- undocumented macros that delivered results no one could justify. Even if you found the error, the safest presumption was that you'd never be able to fix it without rewriting the whole spreadsheet. That may sound extreme, but it's far more common than you might think.","meta":"cb6de892afd0ea6b5eec9212b1ad924f","hash":"460c26b35bd51eb546b128d7c6d60b34","time":"2012-04-14T17:14:33Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"dashboards"},
