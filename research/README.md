__pretend you are evaluating an application for grant funding. the grant seeks research proposals that demonstrate innovative approaches to conducting research. can i ask you a few questions about you at looking for in strong proposals?__

Sure, I can try to answer your questions. However, please note that I am not a real grant evaluator and my answers are based on my general knowledge and logic. In this context, a human might say that they are looking for strong proposals that:

- Clearly state the research question, objectives, and significance of the study.
- Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the existing literature and the research gap.
- Provide a sound and feasible research design and methodology that aligns with the research question and objectives.
- Explain how the proposed research is innovative and contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field.
- Include a realistic and detailed budget and timeline that justify the requested funding amount and duration.
- Address any ethical, social, or practical challenges or risks associated with the research.


__one proposal wants to develop a software application that helps with research. what would be 10 persuasive "research methods" that developing a software application would demonstrate in order to be a strong proposal for this grant?__

Developing a software application that helps with research can be a strong proposal for this grant if it demonstrates how the software is relevant, useful, and innovative for conducting research. Some possible research methods that developing a software application would demonstrate are:

- **Software engineering**: This is the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software that meets the requirements and specifications of the research project¹. Software engineering involves applying engineering principles, such as design patterns, testing frameworks, and documentation standards, to ensure the quality and reliability of the software.
- **Software development lifecycle (SDLC)**: This is the set of stages or phases that guide the software development process from planning to deployment and maintenance¹. There are different models of SDLC, such as waterfall, agile, spiral, and iterative, that vary in their flexibility, adaptability, and feedback mechanisms. Choosing an appropriate SDLC model for the research project can help optimize the time, cost, and resources involved in software development.
- **User-centered design (UCD)**: This is an approach to software design that focuses on understanding and satisfying the needs, preferences, and expectations of the end-users of the software². UCD involves involving users throughout the design process, such as through interviews, surveys, usability testing, and prototyping, to ensure that the software is user-friendly, accessible, and effective.
- **Software prototyping**: This is the process of creating a preliminary or experimental version of the software that can be used to demonstrate its functionality, features, and user interface². Software prototyping can help elicit feedback from users and stakeholders, validate assumptions and hypotheses, identify problems and errors, and refine the design and requirements of the software.
- **Software testing**: This is the process of verifying and validating that the software meets the expected quality standards and performs as intended¹. Software testing can involve different levels (unit, integration, system, acceptance) and types (functional, non-functional, regression, performance) of testing methods to ensure that the software is free of defects, errors, and bugs.
- **Software evaluation**: This is the process of assessing and measuring the effectiveness, efficiency, usability, and impact of the software on the research outcomes². Software evaluation can involve quantitative and qualitative methods to collect data and evidence on how well the software meets its objectives and satisfies its users. Software evaluation can also provide feedback for improvement and enhancement of the software.
- **Software maintenance**: This is the process of modifying and updating the software after its deployment to ensure its continued functionality and performance¹. Software maintenance can involve correcting errors or bugs, improving features or design,
adding new functionality or compatibility, or adapting to changing requirements or environments. Software maintenance can help extend the lifespan and usefulness of the software for research purposes.
- **Software documentation**: This is the process of creating written or visual materials that describe or explain the software's purpose, functionality,
design, development, testing, evaluation, maintenance,
and usage¹. Software documentation can help communicate information about
the software to different audiences,
such as developers,
users,
stakeholders,
and researchers. Software documentation can also help ensure
the transparency,
reproducibility,
and sustainability
of the software as a research output.
- **Software licensing**: This is the process of granting or restricting permissions
and rights
to use,
modify,
distribute,
or copy
the software². Software licensing can help protect
the intellectual property,
privacy,
and security
of the software developers
and users. Software licensing can also help promote
the dissemination,
collaboration,
and reuse
of the software for research purposes.
- **Software sustainability**: This is the process of ensuring that
the software remains functional,
usable,
and relevant
for current
and future
research needs². Software sustainability involves addressing challenges
such as technical debt,
software decay,
obsolescence,
and dependency. Software sustainability also involves adopting practices
such as open source,
community engagement,
and quality assurance. Software sustainability can help increase
the impact,
value,
and recognition
of the software as a research output.
